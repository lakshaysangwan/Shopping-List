# Shopping-List
Shopping App using HTML, CSS and JS.

This is a simple app which takes input to add in list and delete with the provied button alongside the item name. It was made with sole purpose of practicing concepts of programming using interactivity of javascript. this project helped me in understanding some native javascript features for webdev.
